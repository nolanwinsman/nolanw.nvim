# Why Doth Use Neovim?

Now technically this title reads "Why Does Use Neovim?" which isn't really English but I thought it was funny. This document is an overview of why I recommend learning and using Neovim. It also includes some background information on my Neovim configuration. This
doesn't really cover how to use Neovim, it's more about my experience with it and why I recommend it.

I will do my best to include links to articles and videos that explain certain concepts better than I do here. I already created a Youtube video that covers a decent amount of information in this article but also has a nice visual element.

## Neovim History

I think it's important to understand a little bit of the background of where Neovim came from. This article is much more in depth so I recommend you read through it
[Understanding the Origins and the Evolution of Vi & Vim](https://pikuma.com/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor). I will provide a super brief summary of the history though. In the 70s, there was Vi which was a revolutionary new text editor mainly used for programming.
In the 90s, Vim (Vi Improved) was created as an improvement to Vi and kind of a 2.0 version. Then in the 2010s, Neovim as an improvement to Vim with the main benefit being the Lua configurations.
Now Vim and Neovim are somewhat similar upon a fresh install so for the rest of this article I will be refering to Neovim as Vim since I think it sounds cooler and I don't want to be typing all those extra characters.
I've barely touched Vi unless it's the only text editor installed on a server so I won't really be
talking about Vi in this article.

## What is Vim?

Vim is a fast customizable modal text editor with an emphasis on using your keyboard for everything. Never touch the mouse. When you first start out it can feel like you're writing left handed (or with your feet if you're ambidextrous). It is very confusing and
funky. For at least 20 years there has been a joke about "How do I exit Vim?" While this joke is goofy, it exists for a reason; Like a lot of things in Vim, exiting Vim is not intuitive. You really need to watch a guide or two and practice to do even the most basic things
in Vim.

## Vim Modes

Now I mentioned that Vim is a modal editor which just means it has different modes. This is another funky feature at first because most other text editors you've probably used have one mode, typing.
Vim has four primary modes (and some other less used modes);

- Normal Mode: Primarily used to move around and adjust your cursor using your mouse. Also includes copying/pasting/editing the text.
- Insert Mode: The standard typing mode. Fairly similar to what you've used before.
- Visual Mode: Let's you visually select (highlight) text.
- Command-line Mode: Let's you input different commands.

Switching between modes is confusing at first but once you get some momentum with it you'll be switching between the modes smooth as butter and developing much faster. The different modes are a big part of why you do not need to use your.

## Why Switch to Vim?

It's really not my place to tell you what to do. I just think it's worth considering switching to coding primarily in Vim. If you want to be a VS Code Andy for the rest of your life there's nothing wrong with that. Even my hero John Carmack uses VS Code (or at least
speaks highly of it). A lot of Vim's benefit is how fast it is, but with that statement, I always think back to what a wise professor told me back when I was a young pup, "You spend more time thinking than programming." With all that being said I am just trying to
make the point that switching Vim is up to you and not necessary.

Now here are some of my favorite things about using Vim.

### 1. Vim is Fast

### 2. My Wrist Hurts. Why Keyboard All the Way

Okay so when I tell people how fantastic it is that typing in Vim enables you to never touch your mouse, they look at me like I'm some kind of lunatic. There's two main reasons I love not having to use my mouse when coding.

1. It's faster and you keep your momentum. Taking your hands off your keyboard to move your mouse pointer is a lot slower than you would think.
2. So I don't know if it's because I hurt my wrist helping my brother move a 300 pound safe or I'm just getting old, but my wrist gets sore if I use it too much. I would have some days where I would work a full shift using my mouse a lot, then I would play computer games
   until my bed time and that's a full day of using the mouse. This would cause my wrist to hurt a lot. I have noticed that using my computer mouse less leads to less hurting of my wrist.
